# Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction-in-Telecommunication-Industry
# **Project Description**
The aim of this data science project is to utilize customer demographic information, service usage patterns, tenure, and various other variables to develop predictive models that can forecast whether a particular customer is likely to churn or not. In the context of this project, "churn" refers to customers discontinuing or terminating their subscriptions to the telecommunications company's services.
# **Methodology**

Data Collection: Gather historical customer data from the telecom company's database, including demographic information, service usage, subscription details, and churn status.
Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering to extract relevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, visualize key trends and patterns, and identify potential predictors of churn.
Model Development: Implement various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier to build predictive models for customer churn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Utilize techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Deployment and Integration: Deploy the best-performing model into the telecom company's operational environment, integrating it with existing systems for real-time churn prediction and decision-making.

## Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis conducted in this project has provided valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Several key findings have emerged:
1) Senior citizens exhibit a lower churn rate compared to younger customers.
2) Customers who are single or do not have dependents tend to have a higher churn rate.
3)Customers generally express higher satisfaction with streaming services compared to services like online backup and device protection, resulting in a lower churn rate for streaming services.
4)Tenure has an inverse relationship with churn rate, with customers having a tenure shorter than 5 months having a higher churn rate.
5)Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn compared to those with one or two-year contracts, indicating that longer contract durations are associated with lower churn.
6)Customers with higher monthly charges and lower total charges are more likely to churn, suggesting that the company should consider reducing monthly charges to mitigate churn.
7)The most important features for predicting customer churn, as determined by feature importance, include tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and total charges.

In conclusion, by leveraging insights from exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling, the telecom company can implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall business performance. Continued monitoring and refinement of these strategies based on data-driven insights will be essential for maintaining customer loyalty and competitiveness in the market.
